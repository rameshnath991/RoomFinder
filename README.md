 Hello, I'm Ramesh Nath. In this repository i will be build a Complete 'Room Finder' Web application.Using Node.js, Express.js,  MongoDB, React.js, Next.js, Redux.js, & Tailwind CSS. So are you interested at this project let's connect and explore somethings new. Thanks
## Purpose:

This page allows you to see all users under User Management and all posts under Post Management. You can switch between both User Mangement and Post Management by clicking on their respective button. Reported users and reported posts will appear with a large red flag. You will be able to edit and delete any post and user as an admin.
