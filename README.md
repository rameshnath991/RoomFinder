# RoomFinder

 Hello, I'm Ramesh Nath. In this repository i will be build a Complete 'Room Finder' Web application.
 Using Node.js, Express.js,  MongoDB, React.js, Next.js, Redux.js, & Tailwind CSS. So are you interested at this project let's connect and explore somethings new. Thanks
## Purpose:

This issue is faced by professionals and students alike.  We aim to simplify the process of finding roommates.

## Usage & Functionality:
